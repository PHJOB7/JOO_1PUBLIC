    <h2>Core Principles of the Theory of Entropicity</h2>
    <p>
      The Theory of Entropicity reframes the role of entropy in physics. Below are
      the central ideas distilled from recent essays, preprints and blog posts.
      Each principle is accompanied by a short explanation and supporting
      references.
    </p>
    <h3>Entropy as a Fundamental Field</h3>
    <p>
      ToE posits that entropy is not a secondary measure of disorder but the
      <em>ontic field</em> of the universe【525666122072993†L37-L42】. Rather than being an output of
      physical laws, the entropic field generates space, time, matter and
      information. In the words of the theory’s originator, John Onimisi Obidi,
      the universe rearranges itself through entropy flow, so the geometry of
      reality is a map of entropic gradients【525666122072993†L79-L113】.
    </p>
    <h3>Motion and Gravity as Emergent Properties</h3>
    <p>
      Objects do not attract or repel one another in ToE. Instead, motion arises
      because the entropic field continually reconfigures itself to maximise
      flow【776252195579583†L8-L15】. Gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent property of entropy
      gradients created by mass and energy distributions【423561634356931†L61-L65】. This contrasts with
      Newtonian gravity (a force acting at a distance) and Einstein’s general
      relativity (curved spacetime), offering a third perspective in which
      gravitational attraction emerges from entropic constraints【776252195579583†L112-L125】.
    </p>
    <h3>Time and the Speed of Light as Entropic Consequences</h3>
    <p>
      In the entropic worldview, the passage of time is not fundamental but a
      consequence of entropy flow: the past and future correspond to directions of
      maximal and minimal entropy redistribution【525666122072993†L102-L113】. Similarly, the constancy of
      the speed of light can be derived from entropic principles rather than
      assumed as a postulate【423561634356931†L67-L71】.
    </p>
    <h3>Forces as Paths of Entropic Flow</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc.) are reinterpreted
      in ToE as pathways along which entropy redistributes itself【423561634356931†L73-L77】. What we
      perceive as “forces” are, in this framework, the natural trajectories of the
      entropic field driving systems toward equilibrium.
    </p>
    <h3>Comparison with Established Physics</h3>
    <p>
      ToE challenges both Newtonian mechanics and Einstein’s relativity. Newton’s
      laws are reinterpreted: inertia becomes an expression of a system’s internal
      entropy resisting change, and forces are entropy pathways【423561634356931†L87-L92】. Relativistic
      phenomena such as time dilation emerge as entropic consequences rather than
      axioms【423561634356931†L81-L85】. While ToE is speculative and remains outside the
      mainstream physics community, it offers a unified lens through which to view
      gravity, quantum mechanics and cosmology【423561634356931†L96-L104】.
