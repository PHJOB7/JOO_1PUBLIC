    <h2>The Obidi Actions</h2>
    <p>
      A central innovation of the Theory of Entropicity is the introduction of two
      variational principles — the <strong>Local Obidi Action (LOA)</strong> and the
      <strong>Spectral Obidi Action (SOA)</strong> — which govern the dynamics of the
      entropic field. Together they yield a Master Entropic Equation that plays a
      role analogous to Einstein’s field equations in general relativity【525666122072993†L115-L124】.
    </p>
    <h3>Local Obidi Action (LOA)</h3>
    <p>
      The LOA reframes entropy as the architect of reality by treating variations
      of entropy as fundamental degrees of freedom【61771916848198†L34-L41】. It integrates
      diverse geometric structures from information theory — the Fisher–Rao and
      Fubini–Study metrics and Amari–Čencov α‑connections — into a unified action
      principle【61771916848198†L42-L59】. In this formulation, the entropic metric becomes the
      stage on which physics unfolds: in classical limits it reduces to the
      Fisher–Rao form, quantum‑coherent regimes align with the Fubini–Study
      metric, and irreversible processes are captured by α‑connections【61771916848198†L63-L72】.
      Generalised entropies such as Tsallis, Rényi and Araki’s relative entropy
      appear as deformations of the entropic geometry【61771916848198†L72-L75】.
    </p>
    <h3>Spectral Obidi Action (SOA)</h3>
    <p>
      The SOA pushes the entropic programme further by translating Araki’s
      relative entropy into a global variational principle【61771916848198†L94-L101】. While the
      LOA is local in nature, the SOA introduces non‑local and global constraints
      through spectral data and modular operators. This brings together bosonic
      actions, fermionic bilinears and familiar geometric actions (Einstein–Hilbert
      and Yang–Mills) as projections of a common entropic action【922363920161669†L54-L60】. The
      result is a unified entropic–spectral variational principle in which
      gravity, matter and quantum structures arise from a single underlying
      field【922363920161669†L60-L64】.
    </p>
    <h3>Master Entropic Equation (MEE)</h3>
    <p>
      Variation of the Obidi Actions yields the Master Entropic Equation (MEE).
      This equation governs how entropy gradients evolve and couple to geometry,
      matter and information【525666122072993†L115-L124】. Solutions to the MEE are generally
      approached through iterative methods rather than closed forms【525666122072993†L128-L133】,
      reflecting the probabilistic and information‑theoretic nature of the
      entropic field.
    </p>
    <h3>Entropic Geodesics and Forces</h3>
    <p>
      From the MEE follow secondary structures: <em>entropic geodesics</em>, which
      describe natural paths in the entropic manifold, and an <em>entropy potential
      equation</em> that governs how entropic forces manifest【525666122072993†L115-L124】. In this
      picture, motion results from systems following entropic geodesics rather
      than trajectories in a fixed spacetime.
